## üìÑ The problem Kisaan solves
58% of India's population is dependent on agriculture, this involves seed sellers, laborers, grain merchants and of course farmers, however, there's no established platform for all these people to congregate, communicate, and get advice/help on their issues, Kisaan aims to be that platform. It does so by allowing people from agriculture to log on to a single unified platform where they can share information about their needs and establish contact with others who can help and collaborate with them. 

Kisaan also provides live Market prices for crops and has the unique feature of diagnosing crop diseases, it does so with the help of a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN), the user just has to click a picture of the leaf of the plant suspected to be diseased and the app can provide a live diagnosis with an accuracy of 82%. As of right now a total of 23 diseases for 5 crops are supported.
